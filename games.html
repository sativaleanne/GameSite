            Fluxx was created by Andrew and Kristin Looney and since the original release, many versions have been published.
            I own the Astronomy version, however the gameplay is consistant with any version. This is a fun and quick game to play with 
            friends of any game level. It is also a fun game to pull out at family gatherings. Fluxx is a card game is ever evolving rules and 
            goals. These are dependent on the cards drawn and the players who play them.

            Root is by far my favorite game. Published by Leder Games and designed by Cole Wehrle, 
            Root is a beautifully illustrated strategy game. There are different factions of woodland creatures
            fighting to gain control of the forest(board). Each faction has unique mechanics and goals for winning making
            the game new each time you play. The difficulty on initially learning is high so this game is best for the strategy game 
            enthusiasts. There are expansions that add more factions to play and increasing the players to up to six.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Set Up:</b><br>
            The set up changes depending on which creatures are being played. Each player gets a creature board that 
            describes the goals and actions that creature can take. The board is set up according to the creatures in play.
